# Overview
The aim of this project was to predict the outcome of football matches. Currently, the project is predicting all Premier League and Championship games.

# Data
The data all comes from [api-football](https://www.api-football.com/), for which the various data feeds are well documented [here](https://www.api-football.com/documentation#documentation-v239-api-architecture).

In the current version, we used the match fixtures API to get historical match results for the Premier League and Championship for the last 10 years, as well as to get the upcoming fixtures for the next week.

# Flow

</p>

The first part of the flow is used to get the relevant leagues and corresponding IDs from the API.
